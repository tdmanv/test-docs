Welcome to kanister's documentation!
====================================

Kanister allows domain experts to capture application specific data management
tasks in blueprints which can be easily shared and extended. The framework takes
care of the tedious details around execution on Kubernetes and presents a
homogeneous operational experience across applications at scale.
